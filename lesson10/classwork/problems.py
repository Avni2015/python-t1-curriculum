# Problem 1  ( 1 : 1 )
# Create a variable for your favorite hobby and print it.



# Problem 2  ( 1 : 1 )
# Ask the user for a number.
# Print the number multiplied by 3.



# Problem 3  ( 1 : 1 )
# Print every number from 5 to 10 (inclusive) using a for loop.



# Problem 4  ( 2 : 1 )
# Ask the user for two numbers. 
# Print whether the first is larger, smaller, or equal to the second.



# Problem 5  ( 2 : 1 )
# Use the modulo operator to print whether a random number from 1 to 20 is divisible by 4.



# Problem 6  ( 2 : 1 )
# Ask the user for a number between 1 and 10.
# Use logical operators to print whether it’s in the lower half (1–5), upper half (6–10) or out of range.



# Problem 7  ( 2 : 1 )
# Create a list of 5 animals. 
# Print the length of the list and the second animal.



# Problem 8  ( 3 : 1 )
# Get a random item from the list of colors and print it.
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]



# Problem 9  ( 3 : 2 )
# Ask the user for a number.
# Use a for loop to count how many items in the list of numbers are greater than the user’s number.
numbers = [3, 8, 15, 2, 9, 12]



# Problem 10  ( 3 : 2 )
# Find the largest number in the list and print it.
numbers = [14, 27, 5, 89, 42]



# Problem 11  ( 4 : 2 )
# Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
# Ask the user for two numbers and use your function to print the result.



# Problem 12  ( 4 : 2 )
# Create a global counter starting at 0.
# Write a function that increases it by a random number from 1–5 and prints it.



# Problem 13  ( 5 : 3 )
# Ask the user for a starting number less than 50.
# Use a while loop to add 7 each time until the number is >= 50.
# Print the number at each iteration of the loop.



# Problem 14  ( 6 : 3 )
# Create a list of 6 random integers between 1 and 100.
# Print the list, the sum of its numbers, and how many are even.



# Problem 15  ( 7 : 3 )
# Ask the user for 4 words. Store them in a list.
# While the list is not empty:
# - Remove and print the first word.
# - Then print how many words are left.
