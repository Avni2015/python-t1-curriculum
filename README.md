# Sova Coding Python Trimester 1 Curriculum

## Overview
This curriculum is designed for absolute beginners in Python programming, gradually introducing concepts across 10 lessons.  
It includes **practice problems**, **examples**, and **homework** to reinforce learning.

The lessons cover:  
1. Printing, variables, importing files  
2. Casting, math operators, user input, `for` loops  
3. Comparison operators, `if/else`, modulo, random numbers  
4. Logical operators  
5. Lists (indexing, length, random choice, functions)  
6. Searching lists & counting items  
7. Summing and finding largest items in lists  
8. Functions (return values, local/global variables, common errors)  
9. `while` loop  
10. **Large Problem Set** of 15 problems of varying difficulty covering **all previous lessons**

## How to Use
- **Teacher-led instruction is required.**  
- The teacher will **explain the concepts** using the sample code provided in each lesson.  
- After instruction, students complete **problem sets** for practice.  
- The problems **do not** contain answers â€” students are expected to attempt solutions themselves.  
- Teachers may give hints but encourage independent problem-solving.  
- For Lesson 10, students are **encouraged to solve independently**, with fewer points awarded if teacher help is used.

## Structure
- Each lesson has:  
  - **Sample code**
  - **Practice problems**
  - **Homework problems**
- Lesson 10 only includes a problem set which has **points per problem** based on difficulty.
